➡️Handwritten-Symbol-Recognizer

This is an end-to-end AI-powered web application that allows users to draw handwritten characters — including **digits (0–9), uppercase alphabets (A–Z), lowercase alphabets (a-z) and commonly used symbols** like `@`, `#`, `+`, `-`, `/`, and `=` — directly on an HTML5 canvas. 
The drawn input is then processed in real-time by a **Flask-based backend**, where a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model, trained on the EMNIST dataset along with synthetically generated symbol images, performs character classification.
This project demonstrates the practical integration of **machine learning**, **web development**, and **user interaction** in a clean, responsive web interface. It showcases full-stack development skills and the ability to build a deployable ML-based product.
